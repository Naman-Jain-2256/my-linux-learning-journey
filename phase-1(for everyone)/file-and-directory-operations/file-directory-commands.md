# 📁 File & Directory Commands in Linux – The Fun Edition

## 🧭 Welcome to the Filesystem Adventure!
Welcome to your next quest in the Linux Playground! 🎢 If the terminal is your sword, then file and directory commands are your shield. Get ready to navigate, create, and destroy (responsibly) like a true Linux explorer! 🏕️🐧

## 1. 📂 `ls` – List Directory Contents

```bash
ls             # List files in the current directory
ls -a          # Include hidden files (those starting with .)
ls -l          # Detailed list (permissions, owner, size, timestamp)
ls -lh         # Detailed list with human-readable file sizes
ls -lt         # Sort by modification time, newest first (great for checking recent changes)
ls -lS         # Sort by file size, largest first (useful for spotting big files)
ls -i          # Show inode numbers
ls -R          # Recursively list subdirectories
```

> 🎯 `ls` is your window into any directory. Add flags to filter and format your view like a pro.

## 2. 🚪 `cd` – Change Directory

```bash
cd /path/to/directory   # Go to a specific directory
cd ~                    # Go to your home directory
cd ..                   # Move up one directory
cd -                    # Jump to previous directory
cd subdirectory         # Move into a subdirectory (relative path)
```

> 🧭 Master navigation and you’ll never be lost in the terminal woods again.

---

## 3. 📍 `pwd` – Print Working Directory

```bash
pwd
```

> 🗺️ Lost? `pwd` tells you your current location in the filesystem.

---

## 4. 🛠️ `mkdir` – Make Directory

```bash
mkdir new_folder              # Create one new folder
mkdir folder1 folder2         # Create multiple folders
mkdir -p path/to/new_folder   # Create nested directories
mkdir -m 755 my_folder        # Set permissions while creating
```

> 🏗️ Like placing a new tent in the file forest — make space where needed!

---

## 5. 💣 `rm` – Remove Files or Directories

```bash
rm file.txt                  # Remove a file
rm file1.txt file2.txt       # Remove multiple files
rm -r folder/                # Remove folder and contents
rm -rf folder/               # Force remove, no prompt (danger!)
rm -i file.txt               # Prompt before deleting
rm *.log                     # Remove all .log files in the directory
```
> .log is an example of a file extension. You can replace it with any other file extension you want to remove.
> 
> 💡 Use rm -i or alias rm='rm -i' in your shell config to make deletion safer by default.
>
> ⚠️ Proceed with caution. The `rm -rf` command is powerful enough to wipe out forests.

## 🧠 Bonus Tips

- Use `tree` to see directories as a branching structure. Install it via `sudo apt install tree`.
- Want to go back two levels? Try `cd ../..`
- Use tab to autocomplete paths and filenames — it’s a huge time saver!
- Combine commands: `mkdir new && cd new` creates and enters a directory in one line.
