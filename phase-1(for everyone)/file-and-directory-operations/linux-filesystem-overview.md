# 🗃️ Linux Filesystem Overview

## 🌳 Welcome to the Heart of Linux!

In the world of Linux, the filesystem is your **map, backpack, and toolkit** — all rolled into one! 🎒🐧  
Let’s explore the **magical tree structure** that Linux uses to organize everything, from files to devices.

---

## 🌲 Everything Starts from `/` (Root)

Linux uses a **single-rooted hierarchy**, meaning **everything starts from `/`**, the **root**.  
It’s not a file — it’s the starting point of **all files, folders, and devices**.

> 💡 Think of `/` as the **trunk** of a giant tree. All other directories branch off from it!

## 🗂️ Essential Directories You Should Know

| Directory | What’s Inside |
|----------|------------------|
| `/` | The root of everything |
| `/bin` | Essential command binaries (like `ls`, `cp`, `cat`) |
| `/sbin` | System binaries (like `reboot`, `fsck`) |
| `/etc` | Configuration files for your system and software |
| `/home` | Personal user folders (e.g., `/home/naman`) |
| `/root` | Home folder of the **root** (admin) user |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files (auto-deleted after reboot) |
| `/var` | Variable data like logs (`/var/log`) and mail |
| `/usr` | User software & utilities (`/usr/bin`, `/usr/lib`) |
| `/opt` | Optional software (usually third-party apps) |
| `/lib` | Libraries needed by programs in `/bin` and `/sbin` |
| `/dev` | Device files (USB, HDD, etc.) |
| `/proc` | Virtual directory for **process and kernel** info |
| `/media` & `/mnt` | Mount points for external drives |
| `/boot` | Files needed for booting the system (like the kernel) |

> 🧭 Don’t memorize — explore! Use `ls /` and `cd` to roam these folders.

├── etc/
├── home/
│   └── your_username/
├── lib/
├── media/
├── mnt/
├── opt/
├── proc/
├── root/

├── tmp/
├── usr/
└── var/
```

## 🔎 Real-Life Examples

| Task | Path |
|------|------|
| Your personal files | `/home/Your_username/` |
| Your shell config | `/home/Your_username/.bashrc` |
| System network config | `/etc/network/interfaces` |
| CPU info (virtual file) | `/proc/cpuinfo` |
| System logs | `/var/log/syslog` |

## 💬 Fun Facts

- 🔁 The Linux filesystem is **case-sensitive**: `File.txt` ≠ `file.txt`.
- 🎩 The **root user** has a separate home: `/root/` (not `/home/root/`)
- 🛠️ You can mount external devices inside the filesystem (e.g., USBs show up in `/media/username/`)

## 🎯 Pro Tips for Navigating

- `cd /` → Go to the root directory  
- `cd ~` → Go to your home directory  
- `cd ..` → Move up one level  
- `ls /etc` → View system config files  
- `ls /var/log` → Explore system logs  
- `df -h` → View disk space of mounted filesystems

## 🧠 Bonus Analogy

> Think of Linux as a **huge apartment complex**:
>
> - `/` is the **building entrance**
> - `/home/username/` is **your flat**
> - `/etc/` is the **building's control room**
> - `/var/` is **mailroom & garbage chute**
> - `/boot/` is the **power switch**
> - `/dev/` is the **control panel for devices**
