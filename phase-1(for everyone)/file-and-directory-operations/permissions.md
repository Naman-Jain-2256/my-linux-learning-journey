# 🔐 File Permissions & Ownership in Linux – The Access Mastery Edition

## 🧭 Welcome to the World of Permissions!
Time to unlock the power of access control in Linux! 🗝️
Permissions and ownership decide who can do what with files and directories — and you're about to become the Gatekeeper of Filesystems! 🧙‍♂️🛡️

---

## 1. 🔍 Understanding Permissions at a Glance
### Use ls -l to View Permissions:
```bash
ls -l file.txt
```
> Example Output:
```
-rwxr-xr-- 1 user group 0 Jan 1 00:00 file.txt
```
> Breakdown:
- `-` → file (or `d` for directory)
- `rwx` → read, write, and execute permissions for the owner
- `r-x` → read and execute permissions for the group
- `r--` → read permission for others
> 📖 Think of it as: `[type][owner][group][others]`

---

## 2. 🛠️ `chmod` – Change File Permissions
```bash
chmod +x file.sh              # Add execute permission
chmod -w file.txt             # Remove write permission
chmod u+x file.sh             # Add execute permission for user (owner)
chmod g-w file.txt            # Remove write from group
chmod o=r file.txt            # Set others to read-only
chmod 755 file.sh             # Set numeric permissions (rwxr-xr-x)
```
> 🧠 Tip: `u = user`, `g = group`, `o = others`, `a = all`

### Numeric Permissions Table
| Symbolic | Numeric | Meaning              |
| -------- | ------- | -------------------- |
| rwx      | 7       | read, write, execute |
| rw-      | 6       | read, write          |
| r--      | 4       | read only            |
| r-x      | 5       | read, execute        |
| ---      | 0       | no permissions       |

---

## 3. 👤 `chown` – Change File Owner
```bash
chown username file.txt            # Change owner
chown username:group file.txt      # Change owner and group
sudo chown -R user:group folder/   # Change ownership recursively
chown --reference=ref_file.txt file.txt  # Match permissions to another file
```
> 🛠️ Ownership matters! Only the file's owner (or root) can change its permissions.

---

## 4. 👥 `chgrp` – Change Group Ownership
```bash
chgrp developers file.txt      # Change group to 'developers'
sudo chgrp -R team folder/     # Change group recursively
chgrp --reference=ref_file.txt file.txt  # Match group to another file
```
> 🎯 Use this if you want to manage access for group collaborations.

---

## 5. 🎭 `umask` – Default Permission Mask
```bash
umask                # View current umask value
umask 022            # Set new umask (default removes write for group & others)
umask 077            # Set strict permissions (only owner can read/write)
```
> 🔐 `umask` sets the default permission subtraction for newly created files.
>
> For example, `umask 022` = default 755 for directories and 644 for files.

---

## 🧠 Bonus Tips
- Use `chmod +x your_script.sh` to make any script executable.
- Use `stat file.txt` to inspect current permissions and owner info.
- Use `groups` to check which groups a user belongs to.
- Want to give access without changing ownership? Consider `ACLs` (advanced topic).
